- Temporarily, site is available on http://mysite.joetomcoffees.com/ 
- There is no SSL certificate, so there is high probability, that your browser will block it. Domain is not mine. This particular subdomain just redirects all requests to my server. (because of this redirection as well - browser might block the site) <br> 
If you want, you can believe me and that kind man (domain owner) and go there anyway.
- Site might be not available time-to-time, because I host it from my home server, which is not always turned on.
- And, please, note, that right now location is static - only Europe/Moscow. It will be fixed in later versions (I will add automatic city detection and selection of city a bit later)
